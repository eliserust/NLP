# NLP
Repository of NLP code from research and courses (Text Pre-Processing, Semantic Similarity Scores, Vector Paraphrase, Word2Vec, etc.(

Currently enrolled in Computational Programming and Linguistics as part of Georgetown's Master's of Data Science and Analytics program for Spring 2022. The course is designed and taught by Professor Elizabeth Merkhofer. Topics include semantic text similarity, paraphrase identification, feature extraction, usage of TFIDF vectorizers, stemmers, BLEU, WER, NIST, LCS, cosine similarity, and various machine learning models (SVM, logistic regression).

Starting March 21st I will be working as a Research Assistant for Professor Nita Rudra in Georgetown's Government Department, using NLP and deep learning models to parse SEC labor documents. Related code will be put here.
